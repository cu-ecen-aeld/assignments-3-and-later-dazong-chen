Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking.
/home/dazong/Desktop/AESD/assignment-4-dazong-chen/assignment-autotest/test/assignment4/Test_threading.c:86:test_threading_single_locked_mutex:PASS
Start a thread which waits 250ms before attempting to obtain a mutex, then waits
250ms to release.  Since we aren't locking the mutex in this case, the thread
should not block on mutex_lock()

Setting up thread 1
Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
until 1 millisecond after locking.
Setting up thread 2
Start a thread obtaining a locked mutex, sleeping 1 millisecond before locking and waiting to return
